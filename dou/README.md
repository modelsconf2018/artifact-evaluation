Welcome to TemPsy-Report
==========

TemPsy-Report is a software program that performs model-driven trace diagnostics of *TemPsy* properties. It is published at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6797171.v1 as an Eclipse project with the [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). The program was developed by [Wei Dou](https://github.com/weidou) during his PhD research at the [SVV lab](http://www.svv.lu) of the [University of Luxembourg](http://wwwen.uni.lu).

*TemPsy* (**Tem**poral **P**roperty Made Ea**sy**) is a domain specific language based on [OCL](http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL) (Object Constraint Language) which allows users to express temporal properties using [property specification patterns](http://patterns.projects.cis.ksu.edu). *TemPsy* is a revised language of *OCLR*, which has been introduced in this paper:

Inputs of TemPsy-Report
---
The inputs of TemPsy-Report consists of 12 temporal property files (in XMI format) and corresponding trace files (in CSV format). 

#### Properties
We provide 12 *TemPsy* properties in XMI format (under the *inputs/properties/* folder). These XMI instances were generated from the DSL specifications using [TemPsy.jar](https://github.com/weidou/TemPsy-Check/releases/tag/v1.4.1-jars).

#### Traces
We provide a shell script (*inputs/traces/trace_generator.sh*) to generate the traces for the 12 properties.
In fact, the traces are generated by the generator program (*inputs/traces/trace_generator.py*) which implements various generation strategies, depending on the type of pattern that one wants to diagnose on the trace being generated.
The Python program runs with 2 parameters:
  1. pattern (```--pattern/-p PATTERN```);
  2. property id (```--id/-i ID```);
  For instance:
  ```./trace_generator.py -p'always a' -i p1```
  corresponds to generating traces for the diagnostics of p1 that was presented in the evaluation section of our MODELS 2018 paper.
